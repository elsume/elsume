## Problem Overview
Imagine you are a contestant on a game show and before you are three doors. $10,000 in cash has randomly been placed behind one door. Behind the other two doors are the consolation prizes of dishwasher detergent. The game show host asks you to select a door, and you randomly pick one. However, before revealing the prize behind your door, the game show host reveals one of the other doors that contains a consolation prize. At this point, the game show host asks if you would like to stick with your original choice or to switch to the remaining door. What do you choose?

This program lets the user to experience the aforementioned scenario. It allows the user play the game repeatedly - keeping track of the number of times the user stayed with the original choice and the number of times the user switched to the alternate door. For each choice, the program keeps track of the win/loss ratio and will report the results when the user chooses to stop playing.

As an alternative to playing the game directly, this program also allows the user to simulate the game show problem a selected number of times. The program will randomly select locations for the prizes, select a door at random chosen by the contestant, and then randomly choose to either stay with the original choice or switch to the alternate door. As before, the program will also keep track of the win/loss ratio and report the results when the user chooses to stop playing.
